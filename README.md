# VCV Playground

My growing plugin full of stuff mined from the Rack body of work.

It started as Template and is now many cycles through edit/make/(quit)/make run as I made step-wise changes usually not breaking anything too badly.

Mostly I just saw stuff I wanted to be able to use and hunted them down using 'find' and 'grep', my best Unix friends.
